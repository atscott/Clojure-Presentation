                <aside class="notes">
                    It turns out that Lisp source code is actually a valid data structure called an abstract syntax tree
                    (AST). This makes metaprogramming easier since code can be treated as a basic data structure that
                    the programming language knows how to access.

                    It means that a program could be designed to read, generate, analyse or transform other programs,

                <aside class="notes">
                    basically means the program structure is similar to its syntax, and therefore the program’s internal
                    representation can be inferred by reading the text’s layout. This capability allows you to extend
                    the functionality of the language and manipulate it on the fly at runtime without having to
                    recompile the whole OS to integrate new code. In other languages, we would have to recompile from
                    human-language source code into valid syntax tree before it is compiled into code.

                <h2>Macros and Clojure</h2>
                <aside class="notes">
                    So what are some of the benefits of a language being homoiconic?

                    It makes it relatively easy to write DSLs. One of the more powerful effects of being homoiconic
                    though is the ability to define custom macros.

                    Macros in essence allow you to define new language features as a developer. In most languages you
                    would need to wait for a new release of the language to get new syntax – in Lisp (and Clojure) you
                    can just extend the core language with macros and add the features yourself.

(when (true) (println “hello”))
; => “hello”
                </code></pre>
                <pre class="fragment"><code>
(macroexpand ‘(when (true) (println “hello”)))
; (if (true) (do (println “hello”)))

            <aside class="notes">
                You could do something similar with functions, but it’s not the same. Functions execute at run-time,
                they take and produce data (values). Macros execute at compile-time, they take and produce code.
                Macros arguments are not evaluated and their return values are expanded-in-place and treated as code.

                    - The old version remains accessible
                    - The new version can be produced efficiently
                    - Both versions satisfy the complexity guarantees
                </section>

                <aside class="notes">
                    The new version can be produced while meeting the time complexity guarantees of the data structure.
                    For example, adding to the end of a list should take constant time.
                    Some people have attempted in the past to cheat where the latest version is as fast as you would
                    expect but older versions sort of decay. There is no cheating going on in Clojure so even old versions meet
                    the complexity guarantees.

                <h2>How?</h2>

                <section data-markdown>
                    - Data structures are hash array mapped tries
                    - Shallow with high branching factors
                    - Structural Sharing
                </section>
                <aside class="notes">
                    is an implementation of an associative array that combines the characteristics of a hash table and an
                    array mapped trie. It is a refined version of the more general notion of a hash tree.

                    draw a HAMT
                    What does it mean to add to the end?
                    1. Take the last array, copy it (bounded size of 32 so it's constant time)
                    2. copy the path to the root
                    3. New root, new path to the right side, but everything else is shared

                    So the left trie has a million items in it, and you only change 3 nodes on the right side to add
                    something to the end.

            <aside class="notes">
                So instead of saying "change this thing in place", you say "call this transformation function which
                gives a new thing and give me that".
                That changes your life. Now you can share these things in a way that you could never before because
                with an object, you don't know if you have to clone it, if it's going to change, etc.

            <aside class="notes">
                Traditionally composed of direct references to things that can change. As soon as you've done that, you are
                stuck with locking and managing synchronization. Why is this bad? Everything is manual and everything is
                convention (we're locking A before B, we're locking alphabetically, there's a lock over here for these 3 things,
                don't forget to lock before you do this). Where does all this go?

                Contrast with Clojure: Rather than having things actually change, you have indirect references to things that
                can never change. But those references can be made to refer to other things over the course of the application.
                Gives the same effect of changing over time. Clojure has concurrency semantics for these references. Because
                they are indirect, your program isn't just twiddling them, your program has to use functions to make them
                point to different things. And those functions have concurrency semantics. Which means that they're automatic,
                the language helps you change the things to point to other things and not mess that up, and it's enforced. For
                instance, some references can only be changed inside a transaction; if you try to change it outside a transaction
                it throws an exception.

                Big difference - all convention, all manual. Clojure - things never change. If you dereference one of the references,
                you get an immutable object. If someone makes that reference point to something else while you're doing calculations, do you care? No.
                There are also no locks in the application program.
